The find command in Linux provides a wide range of options and arguments that allow you to search for files and directories based on various criteria. Here is a comprehensive list of commonly used options and arguments for the find command:

Basic Usage: - find [starting_directory] [expression]

Common Options:

	1. -name pattern: Search for files and directories with a specific name pattern.
	
		  - Example: find /path/to/search -name "*.txt"
	
	2. -type type: Specify the type of files to search for (`f` for regular files, `d` for directories, `l` for symbolic links, etc.).
	
	   - Example: find /path/to/search -type f
	
	3. -maxdepth levels: Limit the depth of the search to a specific number of directory levels.
	
	   - Example: find /path/to/search -maxdepth 2
	
	4. -mindepth levels: Start the search after a specific number of directory levels.
	
	   - Example: find /path/to/search -mindepth 2

Time-Based Options:

	5. -mtime days: Search for files modified `n` days ago.
	
	   - Example: find /path/to/search -mtime -7
	
	6. -atime days: Search for files accessed `n` days ago.
	
	   - Example: find /path/to/search -atime +30
	
	7. -ctime days: Search for files with status changes `n` days ago.

Size-Based Options:

	8. -size [+|-]size: Search for files of a specific size (e.g., `+10M` for larger than 10 MB, `-1G` for smaller than 1 GB).

Ownership and Permissions:

	9. -user username: Search for files owned by a specific user.
	
	   - Example: find /path/to/search -user john
	
	10. -group groupname: Search for files owned by a specific group.
	
	    - Example: find /path/to/search -group developers
	
	11. -perm permissions: Search for files with specific permissions (e.g., `-perm 644` for read/write permissions for the owner).
	
	    - Example: find /path/to/search -perm 644

Logical Operators:

	12. -and: Combine multiple conditions using logical AND.
	
	    - Example: `find /path/to/search -name "*.txt" -and -type f`
	
	13. -or: Combine multiple conditions using logical OR.
	
	    - Example: `find /path/to/search -name "*.txt" -or -name "*.log"`
	
	14. !: Negate a condition.
	
	    - Example: `find /path/to/search ! -name "*.tmp"`

Actions:

	15. -exec command {} \; : Execute a command on each found item.
	
	    - Example: find /path/to/search -type f -exec ls -l {} \;
	
	16. -print: Print the names of found items to the standard output.
	
	17. -delete: Delete found items (use with caution).

Additional Options:

	18. -follow: Follow symbolic links and search their targets.
	
	19. -xdev: Exclude other mounted filesystems.

These are some of the most commonly used options and arguments for the `find` command. You can combine them to create complex search criteria to locate files and directories in the Linux file system. Be cautious when using options like `-delete` to avoid accidental data loss.

Common Options:

	1 . Find Files by Name:  find . -name "example.txt"
	
			Ø To find files with a specific name, use the -name option followed by the filename in quotes.
	
		[diwakar@devops ~]$ sudo find / -name 'passwd'
		/sys/fs/selinux/class/passwd
		/sys/fs/selinux/class/passwd/perms/passwd
		/etc/passwd
		/etc/pam.d/passwd
		/usr/bin/passwd
		/usr/share/licenses/passwd
		/usr/share/doc/passwd
		/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/passwd
	
	2. Find Files by Type: find . -type d
	
			Ø Use the -type option to specify the type of file to search for (f for regular files, d for directories, etc.).
			
		sudo find / -type c > character_files
		sudo find / -type b > block_files
		sudo find / -type l > link_files
		sudo find / -type s > socket_files
		sudo find / -type p > pipe_files
		
Size-Based Options:

	3. Find Files by Size: find . -type f -size +1M
	
			Ø Use the -size option to search for files of a specific size.
			
		[diwakar@devops ~]$ sudo find / -type f -size +1G
		/proc/kcore
		
		[diwakar@devops ~]$ sudo find / -type f -size +50M
		/boot/initramfs-0-rescue-123877d16b1a4543a76b90f9266f9414.img
		/proc/kcore
		/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite
		/var/cache/dnf/baseos-044cae74d71fe9ea/packages/linux-firmware-20230814-139.el9.noarch.rpm
		
Time-Based Options:
		
	4. Find Files by Modification Time: find . -type f -mtime -7   (mtime,mmin,ctime,cmin,atime,amin)
	
			Ø Use the -mtime option to search for files based on their modification time (in days).
	
		[diwakar@devops ~]$ find . -type f -cmin +5
		./.bash_logout
		./.bash_profile
		./.bashrc
		
		[diwakar@devops ~]$ find . -type f -atime 0
		./.bash_logout
		./.bash_profile
		./.bashrc
		./socket_files
		
Logical Operators:
		
	5.Combining Multiple Conditions : find . -type f -name "*.txt" -size +100k
	
			Ø find . -type f -name "*.txt" -size +100k
		
		[diwakar@devops ~]$ find . -type f -name "*.txt" -size +1k
		./text_processing.txt
		
		[diwakar@devops ~]$ find . -type f -name "*"  -and -name "*.txt"
		./nexample.txt
		./text_processing.txt
		
Ownership and Permissions:

	6.  -user username`: Search for files owned by a specific user. `-group groupname`: Search for files owned by a specific group.
	
			> sudo find / -user diwakar > diwakarfiles &
